                    <h4>Carlos</h4>
                    <p>Carlos Daniel Esparza is a Broadcast Journalism major, former host of the podcast, The Spark and current host of CSULA, Cali Sports Under Loud Analysis. His infatuation with sports has existed since he was a child when he played soccer with his dad and participated in AYSO. He started following basketball and baseball religiously in the sixth grade and expanded to all sports once he hit high school.  It wasn't until he met John Ireland of ESPN that his dream of being a sports commentator was realized. Upon taking a Sports Journalism class with Prof. Tony Cox, he found that his dream can in fact become reality. Daniel is a really knowledgeable person and is not afraid to speak his mind especially with controversial events in sports. He knows that with Golden Eagle Radio, it can open many doors he never knew existed before joining the station. When not hitting the books or prepping for the show, Daniel enjoys playing basketball and softball with friends and his recreation league as well as playing Battlefield or Call of Duty on Xbox Live.

                    <h4>Fred</h4>
                    <p>Hello my name is Fred Zuniga aka DJ Phat and I am the host the DJ Phat Jam Session where it's basically an hour-long show of jamming out to the best hot new music, some info on your favorite artists, and some Cal State LA news. The music is mainstream Hip-Hop, club bangers, and a little bit of dance music to get you hyped up for the weekend while you're at your crib getting yourself looking just right before you head out the door.</p>
                    <p>My love for radio started when I was growing up listening to various local radio stations in Brownsville, Texas (Mexican, rock, and hip-hop radio stations) and I remember just dancing to music with my family and friends while I'd pretend I was one of the DJs playing music. A few years down the road, I'm living in California and start training to be radio host on a small internet radio station in Anaheim where I produced a one-hour live broadcast show while I was enrolled in the Cinema, TV, film, and Radio program at Saddleback Community College in Orange County. I was part of their Internet radio station—OC ROCK RADIO—and had a three-hour shift playing rock music while taking other audio production classes that gave me the experience on producing, recording, and editing commercials, news segments, and radio promotions. Now, I'm majoring in Broadcast Journalism at Cal State LA and jamming out on Golden Eagle Radio.</p>

                  <h4>Eric</h4>
                  <p>Eric Estrada had a passion for music since the day he was born.  He would always annoy his parents by impersonating Spanish artists that he would hear on the radio.  On his fourteenth birthday his dad gifted him with his first computer.  He wasted no time in reaching out to the internet and downloading music from his favorite artists.  By the time he was fifteen, he had more than half of his hard drive full of music.  Soon after a friend of his brought over a DJ controller.  Eric watched him DJ and was amazed by the things you could do with music.  That right away sparked an enthusiasm in him that led him to become a DJ.  Now known as Dj Estradation, he is known for the unique blending of Spanish and English genres.  Estradation can take you from a classic merengue to a hip-hop hit.  His musical knowledge is endless starting with all great Latino genres like Banda, Cumbia and Merengue to Hip-Hop, Disco, and Funk.  You never know in what musical journey he will take you on next.  Estradation is thankful for his parents as they were the strongest base for him to pursue this goal.  One thing is for sure, this talented DJ is continuing to rise up.  No matter were this musical talent takes him, all he wants is to make people dance.</p>

                    <p>Juventino Monteon better known as JR-TRON grew up near the Los Angeles area and was always exposed with many different cultures of music. As a kid, he was influenced by his mothers 80s music with new wave, his fathers latin music, and the rest of his family members that were into other genres. His father was a DJ and by the time he was eleven years old he would go out with his father to play at gigs and was until he turned eighteen that was able to manage his own gigs mixing in different styles of music. He gets a lot of his influence from labels like Soulection, Stones Throw, and Future Classic. Jr is a undergraduate student working towards a Communication Studies degree in Public Relations to improve his future. Music has always been a huge component of his life, at the time when he started college he instantly started doing mixes and posting them on his sound cloud page making it the best way to show everyone a new sound of music. Since his idea of music became interesting to people he was blessed to start Soulversity, which is the show that takes you through a journey of soulful beats, sounds of the future, and takes you back to the root of all genres. MUSIC FOR ALL SOULS.
