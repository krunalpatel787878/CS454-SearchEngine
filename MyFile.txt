the

it
s
important
to
have
systems
in
place
particularly
on
college
campuses
lopez
told
a
rapt
audience
packed
into
the
los
angeles
room
of
the
university
student
union
when
you
have
people
on
campus
and
professionals
who
can
help
it
can
make
all
the
difference
lopez
s
comments
came
during
a
discussion
sponsored
by
the
mind
matters
initiative
and
one
campus
one
book
the
goal
of
mind
matters
is
to
integrate
inner
well
being
into
the
framework
of
university
life
as
a
means
of
supporting
student
success
the
soloist
is
the
true
story
of
nathaniel
anthony
ayers
ayers
was
a
gifted
classical
musician
enrolled
at
julliard
when
he
began
to
suffer
from
what
later
was
diagnosed
as
paranoid
schizophrenia
in
his
los
angeles
times
columns
lopez
wrote
about
how
mental
illness
transformed
ayers
from
a
promising
20
year
old
college
student
into
a
homeless
man
living
on
skid
row
playing
a
violin
with
two
strings
the
columns
placed
a
face
on
mental
illness
for
readers
and
increased
awareness
and
discussion
about
mental
health
readers
response
was
unparalleled
emails
flooded
lopez
s
inbox
readers
sent
violins
cellos
sheet
music
all
in
a
bid
to
help
ayers
it
s
a
there
but
for
the
grace
of
god
story
lopez
told
the
audience
in
a
talk
that
was
at
times
moving
and
humorous
people
were
rooting
for
nathaniel
and
they
were
rooting
for
me
to
be
able
to
help
him
efforts
to
help
ayers
led
lopez
to
explore
the
problems
in
our
nation
s
mental
health
system
that
make
it
difficult
for
people
to
receive
the
help
they
need
often
the
mentally
ill
end
up
in
jail
or
prison
what
happened
was
not
by
accident
we
shut
down
mental
health
institutions
across
the
land
lopez
explained
we
never
followed
through
with
the
promise
of
community
clinics
recovery
is
possible
lopez
said
but
it
takes
outreach
and
supportive
services
with
lopez
s
help
ayers
is
now
in
a
mental
health
rehabilitation
facility
ayers
does
not
pity
himself
and
continues
to
be
devoted
to
music
the
anchor
in
his
life
those
in
the
audience
asked
lopez
questions
about
policies
relating
to
homeless
people
the
ethical
challenges
of
writing
about
a
person
who
is
mentally
ill
and
about
ayers
current
state
nathaniel
found
what
we
are
looking
for
lopez
said
we
re
looking
for
our
passion
lopez
encouraged
the
audience
to
look
past
generalizations
about
the
homeless
and
those
who
are
mentally
ill
he
and
ayers
are
friends
they
have
traveled
to
the
white
house
and
have
appeared
at
conferences
advocating
for
those
with
mental
illness
the
soloist
was
made
into
a
movie
starring
robert
downey
jr
and
jamie
foxx
gary
foster
the
producer
of
the
movie
will
participate

exhibit

responses
to

which
can
include
calm
hysteria
withdrawal
anxiety

being

needed
to

through
the
experience
vary
with
each

there
is
no
right
way
to
react
to

assumptions
about
the
way
a
victim
should
act
may
be
detrimental
to
the
victim
because
each
victim
copes
in
different
ways
myth
all
sexual
assault
victims
will
report
the
crime
immediately
to
the
police
if
they
do
not
report
it
or
delay
in
reporting
it
then
they
must
have
changed
their
minds
after
it
happened
wanted
revenge
or
didn
t
want
to
look
like
they
were
sexually
active
fact
there
are
many
reasons
why
a
sexual
assault
victim
may
not
report
the
assault
to
the
police
or
campus
officials
it
is
not
easy
to
talk
about
being
sexually
assaulted
and
can
feel
very
shameful
the
experience
of
retelling
what
happened
may
cause
the
person
to
relive
the
trauma
another
reason
for
delaying
a
report
or
not
making
a
report
is
the
fear
of
retaliation
by
the
offender
there
is
also
the
fear
of
being
blamed
not
being
believed
and
being
required
to
go
through
judicial
proceedings
just
because
a
person
does
not
report
the
sexual
assault
does
not
mean
it
did
not
happen
myth
only
young
pretty
women
are
assaulted
fact
the
belief
that
only
young
pretty
women
are
sexually
assaulted
stems
from
the
myth
that
sexual
assault
is
based
on
sex
and
physical
attraction
sexual
assault
is
a
crime
of
power
and
control
offenders
often
choose
people
whom
they
perceive
as
most
vulnerable
to
attack
or
over
whom
they
believe
they
can
assert
power
men
and
boys
are
also
sexually
assaulted
as
well
as
persons
with
disabilities
assumptions
about
the
typical
victim
might
lead
others
not
to
report
the
assault
because
they
do
not
fit
the
stereotypical
victim
myth
it
s
only
rape
if
the
victim
puts
up
a
fight
and
resists
fact
many
states
do
not
require
the
victim
to
resist
in
order
to
charge
the
offender
with
rape
or
sexual
assault
those
who
do
not
resist
may
feel
if
they
do
so
they
will
anger
their
attacker
resulting
in
more
severe
injury
many
assault
experts
say
that
victims
should
trust
their
instincts
and
intuition
and
do
what
they
believe
will
most
likely
keep
them
alive
not
fighting
or
resisting
an
attack
does
not
equal
consent
myth
someone
can
only
be
sexually
assaulted
if
a
weapon
was
involved
fact
in
many
cases
of
sexual
assault
a
weapon
is
not
involved
the
offender
often
uses
physical
strength
physical
violence
intimidation
threats
or
a
combination
of
these
tactics
to
overpower
the
victim
although
the
presence
of
a
weapon
while
committing
the
assault
may
result
in
a
higher
penalty
or
criminal
charge
the
